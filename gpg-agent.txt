If you see this error below:
  can't connect to `/home/user/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent': No such file or directory

Then launch gpg agent daemon:
  $ gpg-agent --daemon
  GPG_AGENT_INFO=/tmp/gpg-Y1AjlZ/S.gpg-agent:2523:1; export GPG_AGENT_INFO;

then you'll just have to create a symbolic link:
  $ cp -fs /tmp/gpg-Y1AjlZ/S.gpg-agent ~/.gnupg/
